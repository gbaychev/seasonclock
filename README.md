# Season clock

Season clock is a very popular mod for an even more popular game - Don't Starve. Season clock adds ... well, a clock to the HUD showing the current day of the current season.
The original mod can be found [here](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/39296-mod-season-clock/). On the December 1st 2015 the publisher of Don't Starve released the 
'Shipwrecked' DLC into early access, which introduced new seasons and season cycles and of course broke the mod. 

This is the ported, 'Shipwrecked' compatible version of the Season Clock.

**Disclaimer: use this at your own risk. I don't have any responsibility, if it breaks your game**
